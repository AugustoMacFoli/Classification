        <p class="lead">Random Forest is a supervised learning algorithm. It creates a forest and makes it random. The <i>forest</i> it builds, is an ensemble of Decision Trees, most of the time trained with the <i>bagging</i> method. The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>Random Forest is a flexible, easy to use machine learning algorithm that produces, even without hyper-parameter tuning, a great result most of the time. It is also one of the most used algorithms, because itâ€™s simplicity and the fact that it can be used for both classification and regression tasks.</p>
        <p>This example will try to predict if a client will or will not buy a product based on the client's age and estimated income.</p>
